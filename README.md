## UTC is default timezone for airflow so i assumed it and used it as default in currency_exchange_dag.py
## it can be changed with default_timezone = 'smth' if u demand it

## was not sure about input in main.py, contacted HR about it, but got no answer, i guess i asked too late.
## so i used static values for today date and 5 hardcoded currencies to exchange, can also change it if needed
